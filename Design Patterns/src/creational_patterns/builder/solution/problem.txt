Youâ€™re building a word processor similar to Word.
The user can add text or image elements to a document and then export it to a variety of different formats such as HTML, text, and so on.
Look at the implementation of the Document class in the builder package.
Note that if the selected format is HTML, all text and image elements are written to an HTML document.
If the selected format is text, however, only text elements are written to a text file.
You can run the code in the Democlass to see this in action.What are the problems with the current design?
Refactor this design using the builder pattern.
