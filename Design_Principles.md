Design Pattern Principles:

#1: Identify the aspects of application that varies and separate them from what stay the same.

#2: Program to interface / supertype, not implementation.

#3: Favor composition over Inheritance.

#4: Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

#5: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

#6: Principle of The Least Knowledge: Talk only to your immediate friends.
