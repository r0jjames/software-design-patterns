Design Pattern Principles:

- Dependency Inversion  - High-level and Low-level layers should depend on abstractions.

- Single Responsibility - A class should have only one reason to change.

- Identify the aspects of application that varies and separate them from what stay the same.

- Program to interface / supertype, not implementation.

- Favor composition over Inheritance.

- Strive for loosely coupled designs between objects that interact.

- Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
