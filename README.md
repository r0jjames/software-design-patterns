# Software Design Patterns

## Behavioral Patterns 
#### Interaction or communication between objects
### Memento: 
Allows restoring an object to a previous state.
### State: 
Allows an object to behave differently depending on the state it is in.
### Iterator:
Allows iterating over an object without having to expose the objectâ€™s
internal structure (which may change in the future).
### Strategy:
Allows passing different algorithms (behaviours) to an object.
Allows defining a template (skeleton) for an operation. Specific steps will then
be implemented in subclasses.
### Command:
Allows decouple a sender from a receiver. The sender will talk to
the receive through a command. Commands can be undone and persisted.
### Observer:
Allows an object notify other objects when its state changes.
### Mediator:
Allows an object to encapsulate the communication between other
objects.
### Chain of Responsibility:
Allows building a chain of objects to process a
request.
### Visitor:
Allows adding new operations to an object structure without
modifying it.
