# Software Design Patterns

## Behavioral Patterns 
#### Interaction or communication between objects

### Strategy:
Defines a family of Algorithm, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable
Allows passing different algorithms (behaviours) to an object.

### Observer:
Defines one to many dependency between objects so when one object changes state, all of its dependents notified and updated automatically. 
Allows an object notify other objects when its state changes.

### Decorator:
#### Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide the alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.


### Memento: 
Allows restoring an object to a previous state.
### State: 
Allows an object to behave differently depending on the state it is in.
### Iterator:
Allows iterating over an object without having to expose the objectâ€™s
internal structure (which may change in the future).
be implemented in subclasses.
### Command:
Allows decouple a sender from a receiver. The sender will talk to
the receive through a command. Commands can be undone and persisted.

### Mediator:
Allows an object to encapsulate the communication between other
objects.
### Chain of Responsibility:
Allows building a chain of objects to process a
request.
### Visitor:
Allows adding new operations to an object structure without
modifying it.
