As part of building an accounting application, we need to allow the user to import their data in a
variety of formats such as:
-Excel spreadsheets (Windows)
-Number spreadsheets (Mac)
-QuickBook workbooks (special accounting software)
In the future, we may need to support other data formats.
Look at the current implementation of our data reader at chainOfResponsibility/DataReader.

What are the problems with this implementation?
Refactor this code and use the chain of responsibility pattern to solve these problems.

public class DataReader {
    public void read(String fileName) {
        if (fileName.endsWith(".xls")) {
            System.out.println("Reading data from an Excel spreadsheet.");
        }
        else if (fileName.endsWith(".numbers")) {
            System.out.println("Reading data from a Numbers spreadsheet.");
        }
        else if (fileName.endsWith(".qbw")) {
            System.out.println("Reading data from a QuickBooks file.");
        }
        else
            throw new UnsupportedOperationException("File format not supported.");
    }
}
