You’re building a weight loss app.
Your app currently supports two kinds of goals: Weight Loss and Build Muscle.
There’s a plan to support other kinds of goals like Strength Training, Getting Active and so on in the near future.
Look at the implementation of the HomePage class in the abstractFactorypackage of the Exercises project.
Depending on the goal the user selects, they’ll see a different mean plan and workout routine.
What are the problems with this design? Refactor this design using the abstract factory pattern.
