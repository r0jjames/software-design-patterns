We’re building an email client like Outlook. Our client should be able to connect to different mail servers such as
Gmail, Yahoo, etc.
In the adapter package, you can see an interface called EmailProvider.
Our EmailClient class talks to this interface so it’s not coupled to a particular mail service.
Here’s the problem: In the Gmail package, you can find the class (or classes) that Google provides to connect to Gmail.
These classes are shipped as a third-party library that we can add to our application.
We want to re-use these classes but the GmailClient class does not extend our EmailProviderinterface.
Use the adapter problem to convert the interface of GmailClient.

public interface EmailProvider {
  void downloadEmails();
}


public class EmailClient {
  private List<EmailProvider> providers = new ArrayList<>();

  public void addProvider(EmailProvider provider) {
    providers.add(provider);
  }

  public void downloadEmails() {
    for (var provider : providers)
      provider.downloadEmails();
  }
}

public class GmailClient  {
  public void connect() {
    System.out.println("Connecting to Gmail");
  }

  public void getEmails() {
    System.out.println("Downloading emails from Gmail");
  }

  public void disconnect() {
    System.out.println("Disconnecting from Gmail");
  }
}
